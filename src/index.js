/**
 * Welcome! This is the assessment test for Node.js Applicants
 * We hope you enjoy it!
 *
 * Here are a few things you will need to do before starting
 * First, follow the tutorial at https://marcopeg.com/2019/setup-free-postgres
 * to create a postgres database that you will be using as part of this assessment.
 * Then update the values in ../.env with the values from the tutorial
 */

/**
 * Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to accomplish the following tasks
 *
 * 1. Using the files provided in ./data-dump, please populate your postgres database
 * 2. Once you have successfully populated your database, you will be responsible
 *   for creating a REST API capable of performing CRUD operations against the data.
 *   As an optional quest for bonus points you can also implement read capabilities
 *   using GraphQL
 * 3. You now have the pleasure of using your newly created service to demonstrate
 *   it's full capabilities.
 * 4. If time allows we would love to see how you would pull data from an external
 *   API into the main service and then expose it to our client using either
 *   REST endpoints or GraphQL. It can be any free to use API but some interesting ones
 *   we've found is: https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api or https://http.cat/.
