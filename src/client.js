 * Example Client Service
 *
 * This service should be considered a consumer of the main service.
 * We need to be able to integrate with many other teams and so need to ensure
 * our service can be used as seamlessly as possible by others.
 *
 * Here you should implement APIs that consume the APIs already created in our
 * main service. This can be either an express server or another Node.js
 * framework if you have experience with others.
